Let's construct a <code>SupportVectorClassifier</code> class. Note: Jupyter notebook makes for a slightly unusual implementation of object-oriented programming. We'll still build the class piece-by-piece, but a full implementation will be supplied in its own block at the end. Of course, the actual code that can be used or experimented with will be made available on Github."
